Q1. Write a function 'returnDay' that takes one parameter(number from 1 to 7) and returns the day of the week.
(where 1 is Monday, 2 is Tuesday, 3 is Wednesday, etc).

If the number is less than 1 or greater than 7, the function should return null.
Note: Store the days of the week in the array.




Q2. Implement a function “duplicate” to duplicate an array, as shown below:
For input arr=[1,2] duplicate(arr) should return [1,2,1,2]
